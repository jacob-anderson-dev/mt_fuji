#### Lore:
- FUNNY -> was going to have to commit sepuku, only has sepuku knife, but wants most honorable death and is running into volcano.
- Stab self key to remove health and speed but add points, also to reset level if stuck.
- Samurai is trying to sepuku in honor, but keeps coming back to life, and tries to jump into mt fuji.

#### If time permits:
- level editor with MacroQuad Tiled.
- Fall damage
- New ninja types
  - Some ninjas that only summon something and then runs away.
  - Boss ninjas that do huge summon at end of level.
- Respawn points/ checkpoints later.
- Moving platforms
