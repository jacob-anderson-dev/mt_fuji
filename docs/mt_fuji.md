- 5 levels with preset maps.
- Enemies attempt to stop you from reaching exit.
- Controlled with arrow keys
- Schmovement and one really short range melee attack.
- Speedrun timer.
- Music
- Sound Effects.

    - On death respawns at start
  - Enemy
    - Ninjas (constant hurt box)

      - End level screen shows
        - Menu background image
        - Timer value
        - Score (Num enemies killed, sepuku)
        - Proceed button
  - Start
    - Spawn in player here.
    - don't start game until player presses a key
- Jacob
  - Platform
      - trees
      - Pagoda roof
      - birds
  - GUI
    - Timer GUI
        - counts up
    - Health Gui
    - Main menu
    - Pause menu
    - End level gui
    - End game gui / You win, return to hub

#### Verb:
- Fall/Gravity
- Collison
  - Getting hit

  - Before gameplay loop
  - Load textures
- Controls
  - Arrow keys move
  - z to jump
  - x to stab
  - c sepuku
  - v pause menu
    - quit button

#### Lore:
- FUNNY -> was going to have to commit sepuku, only has sepuku knife, but wants most honorable death and is running into volcano.
- Stab self key to remove health and speed but add points, also to reset level if stuck.
- Samurai is trying to sepuku in honor, but keeps coming back to life, and tries to jump into mt fuji.

#### If time permits:
- level editor with MacroQuad Tiled.
- Fall damage
- New ninja types
  - Some ninjas that only summon something and then runs away.
  - Boss ninjas that do huge summon at end of level.
- Respawn points/ checkpoints later.
- Moving platforms
- Semi=permeable platforms.
- Better pathfinding
- Add enemy attack
